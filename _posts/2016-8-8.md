#### Who are we targeting?
The biggest challenge was to determine who our target demographic was.  We made a few hypotheses and assumptions regarding who WTWY wanted donating to and attending their gala.  
* We assumed that wealthy people are more charitable and willing to support a cause, and may be more inclined to support a cause related to their work.  
* We assumed that people in the technology sector would be more willing to support and attend an event sponsored by WTWY.  
* We assumed people in computer science bachelor's programs at local colleges would also be interested in supporting WTWY.  
Our ideal WTWY supporter would be wealthy, and/or supportive of tech initiatives given their own background.
